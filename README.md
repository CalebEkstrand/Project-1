API's - Brewery, Restaurant, Facial Recognition

Overview - The app opens to facial recognition to test whether or not you are intoxicated. If you are there will be an alert telling you to call an uber and nothing else in the app will load. If you are not then you will be taken to a map where you can search Breweries and Restaurants based off location and ratings.
