# Project-1
We are have designed and developed an app called “Foam to the dome” that gives you multi-functional use in locating breweries. With these APIs, we are integrating the ability to refine your search down to the specific type of brewery; nanopub, cidery, etc. In addition, we’re using Google Maps API that will be able to target specific breweries located on the map for accessibility. Cheers!
